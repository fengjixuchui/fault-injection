swifi
=====

swifi is a fault injection framework.  It was originally used for the
RIO File Cache (http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~pmchen/Rio/) and later
ported for use for NOOKS (http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~swift/nooks/).

It is now being ported to Linux 2.6.XX (and maybe beyond) for use for
SEGO.  As part of this porting effort, parts of Udis86, a disassembler
for x86 and x86-64, has been incorporated into the project.  For more
on Udis86, see README.udis86.  Also, Udis86 is now at
https://github.com/vmt/udis86.
